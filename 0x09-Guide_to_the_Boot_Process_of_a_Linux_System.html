<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
The start-up of a Linux operating system follows a step-by-step process. This
process starts with the power on or by running a command in the terminal:

In this tutorial, we'll go through the booting steps of a Linux system.
<h2>2. BIOS and UEFI</h2>
First, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface) program kicks in once the system powers up. Usually, the BIOS
contains all the code to gain initial access to the main machine devices:
<ul>
  <li>keyboard</li>
  <li>display screen</li>
  <li>disk drives</li>
  <li>serial communications</li>
</ul>
However, most of these devices will have dedicated device drivers taking over
once the system boots fully.

<strong
  ><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/bios-vs-cmos-vs-uefi">BIOS and UEFI</a>
  are firmware interfaces that computers use to boot up the operating system
  (OS)</strong
>. Yet, the two programs differ in how they store metadata on and about the
drive:
<ul>
  <li>BIOS uses the Master Boot Record (MBR)</li>
  <li>UEFI uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT)</li>
</ul>
Next, the BIOS or UEFI runs the power-on self-test (POST). The POST does a
series of tasks:
<ul>
  <li>verify the hardware components and peripherals</li>
  <li>
    carry out tests to ensure that the computer is in proper working condition
  </li>
</ul>
Further, if this test finds any error, it commonly shows an error message on the
screen. In case the test fails to detect the RAM, POST triggers a beeping sound.
Finally, if the system passes the POST, it signals the start-up process to the
next stage.
<h2>3. Boot Loader</h2>
Now, the BIOS or UEFI has run the POST to check the state of the machine. Moving
on,
<strong
  >the
  <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/bios-vs-cmos-vs-uefi">BIOS/UEFI</a>
  selects a boot device depending on the system configuration</strong
>. Usually, there's a default boot order:
<ol>
  <li>Hard drives</li>
  <li>USB drives</li>
  <li>CD drives</li>
</ol>
Of course, we can configure the BIOS or UEFI to choose the boot device in any
order. Whatever their order, the computer looks for the boot loader in these
devices one by one. In fact,
<strong
  >a BIOS system has the boot loader located in the first sector of the boot
  device</strong
>; this is the
<a
  class="editor-rtfLink"
  href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/partitioning-disks"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"
  >MBR</a
>. It takes up the first 512 bytes on the disk. On the other hand,
<strong>a UEFI system stores all startup data in an <em>.efi</em> file</strong>.
The file is on the EFI System Partition, which contains the boot loader. For
example, we can use
<a
  href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/extend-logical-extended-partitions-fdisk"
  ><em>fdisk</em></a
>
to check the system partition on our machine:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ fdisk -l
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 232.91 GiB, 250059350016 bytes, 488397168 sectors
Disk model: Samsung SSD 960 EVO 250GB               
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 6907D1B3-B3AB-7E43-AD20-0707A656A1B5

Device            Start       End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/nvme0n1p1     2048   1050623   1048576   512M EFI System
/dev/nvme0n1p2  1050624  34605055  33554432    16G Linux swap
/dev/nvme0n1p3 34605056 488397134 453792079 216.4G Linux filesystem</code></pre>
Notably,
<strong
  >the boot loader is a small program that loads the operating system</strong
>. The main job of the boot loader is to perform three actions with the kernel:
locate on the disk, insert into memory, and execute with the supplied options.
The following are some of the available boot loaders for a Linux system:
<ul>
  <li>LILO</li>
  <li>SYSILINUX</li>
  <li>GRUB2</li>
</ul>
In general, once the computer finds the boot loader on a device, it will run it.
Consequently, this loads a larger and more complex program which eventually
starts our operating system. Let's highlight some of the boot loaders in use
with Linux.
<h3>3.1. LILO</h3>
Initially,
<a href="https://salsa.debian.org/joowie-guest/upstream_lilo">LILO</a> (Linux
Loader) was one of the most widely used Linux boot loaders. However, it has lost
favor because it has no support for multi-boot environments and for UEFI. Also,
it has limited support for new filesystems. Officially, the developers of LILO
halted its development and support in December 2015. Hence, the Linux Loader is
old and mostly obsolete.
<h3>3.2. SYSLINUX</h3>
Equally, <a
  class="editor-rtfLink"
  href="https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=SYSLINUX"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"
  >SYSLINUX</a
>
is a boot loader for the Linux operating system, which runs on a
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/ntfs-vs-fat32-vs-exfat#fat32"
  >FAT filesystem</a
>, typical for a Windows system. In short, its goal is to ease the process of
installing Linux for the first time. Further, SYSLINUX supports several major
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/filesystems">filesystems</a>:
<ul>
  <li>FAT</li>
  <li>ext2</li>
  <li>ext3</li>
  <li>ext4</li>
</ul>
In addition, SYSLINUX can support
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/filesystems#a-betterbutter-filesystem"
  >Btrfs</a
>
and
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/filesystems#3-xfs-90s-for-big-iron"
  >XFS</a
>
filesystems with some constraints.
<h3>3.3. GRUB2</h3>
Despite the many choices, almost all (non-embedded) modern Linux distributions
use GRUB (GRand Unified Boot Loader) because it's very feature-rich:
<ul>
  <li>ability to boot multiple operating systems</li>
  <li>boots both a graphical and a text-based interface</li>
  <li>allows ease of use over a serial cable</li>
  <li>strong command line interface for interactive configuration</li>
  <li>network-based diskless booting</li>
</ul>
Presently,<strong>
  <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/grub.html#Changes-from-GRUB-Legacy"
    >GRUB2</a
  >
  has replaced its past version (GRUB), which is now known as </strong
><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-legacy.html"
  ><strong>GRUB Legacy</strong></a
>. Importantly, we can check for the GRUB version in our system using the
following command:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo grub-install -V
grub-install (GRUB) 2.07-2ubuntu7</code></pre>
Now, let's see what GRUB2 does in the boot process:
<ol>
  <li>takes over from BIOS or UEFI at boot time</li>
  <li>loads itself</li>
  <li>inserts the Linux kernel into memory</li>
  <li>turns over execution to the kernel</li>
</ol>
Notably, the GRUB configuration file is located at <em>/boot/grub</em> by
default:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ls -l /boot/grub/
total 2380
-rw-r--r-- 2 root root 9006 SEP 30 22:14 /boot/grub/grub.cfg
...</code></pre>
Initially, GRUB Legacy had three stages in the boot process:
<ol>
  <li>Stage 1</li>
  <li>Stage 1.5</li>
  <li>Stage 2</li>
</ol>
However, with GRUB2, these stages don't exist anymore. Instead, it contains
various
<em
  ><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/Images.html"
    >*.img</a
  ></em
>
files that serve similar functions. At this point, GRUB2 inserts the kernel into
memory and turns control of the system over to the kernel.
<h2>4. Kernel</h2>
After going through BIOS or UEFI, POST, and using a boot loader to initiate the
kernel,
<strong
  >the operating system now controls access to our computer resources</strong
>. Here, the Linux kernel follows a predefined procedure:
<ol>
  <li>decompress itself in place</li>
  <li>perform hardware checks</li>
  <li>gain access to vital peripheral hardware</li>
  <li>run the init process</li>
</ol>
Next, the init process continues the system startup by running init scripts for
the parent process. Also, the init process inserts more kernel modules (like
device drivers).
<h2>5. Systemd</h2>
To reiterate, the kernel initiates the init process, which starts the parent
process. Here, <strong>the parent of all Linux processes </strong
><strong>is </strong
><strong
  ><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/differences-systemctl-service"
    >Systemd</a
  ></strong
>, which replaces the old
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/differences-systemctl-service"
  >SysVinit</a
>
process. Following the booting steps, Systemd performs a range of tasks:
<ul>
  <li>probe all remaining hardware</li>
  <li>mount filesystems</li>
  <li>initiate and terminate services</li>
  <li>manage essential system processes like user login</li>
  <li>run a desktop environment</li>
</ul>
Indeed, these and other tasks allow users to interact with the system. Lastly,
Systemd uses the<em> /etc/systemd/system/default.target</em> file to decide the
state or target the Linux system boots into.
<h2>6. Run Levels</h2>
<strong
  >In Linux, the run level stands for the current state of the operating
  system</strong
>. Run levels define which system services are running. Previously, SysVinit
identified run levels by number. However, <em>.target</em> files now replace run
levels in Systemd. Further, Systemd activates the <em>default.target</em> unit
by default when the system boots. Let's check our default target:
<pre><code class="language-bash"># systemctl get-default
graphical.target</code></pre>
Now, let's see the link between run level numbers and targets:
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>poweroff.target</em>, <em>run level 0</em>: turn off (shut down) the
    computer
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>rescue.target</em>, <em>run level 1</em>: initiate a rescue shell
    process
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>multi-user.target</em>, <em>run level 3</em>: configure the system as a
    non-graphical (console) multi-user environment
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>graphical.target</em>, <em>run level 5</em>: establish a graphical
    multi-user interface with network services
  </li>
  <li><em>reboot.target</em>, <em>run level 6</em>: restart the machine</li>
  <li><em>emergency.target</em>: emergency run level</li>
</ol>
For instance, the target value for a desktop workstation with a graphical user
interface (GUI) is <em>5</em>. This value stands for <em>run level 5</em> which
is <em>graphical.target</em>. Also, the run level for a server without a GUI is
<em>3</em> because the default target is <em>multi-user.target</em>. In
addition,
<strong>we can change the target (run level) while the system runs</strong>.
This change entails that only services and other units defined under that target
will now run on the system. For example, to switch to <em>run level 3</em> from
<em>run level 5</em>, we can run the following command:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl isolate multi-user.target</code></pre>
Then, to take the system to <em>run level 5</em>, let's run the command:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target</code></pre>
This command returns the run level to <em>graphical.target</em>, equivalent
to<em> level 5</em> for GUI.
<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
In this article, we've seen the boot process of a Linux system. Also, we
discussed several boot loaders and their functions. Finally, we went over the
various run levels that a Linux system can enter during the boot process.
