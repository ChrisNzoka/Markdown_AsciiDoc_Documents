<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to easily co-exist on the same
machine. In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate how to access the host machine from
the guest machine. In the end, we should have a setup where the guest machine
can:
<ul>
  <li>Use the Internet</li>
  <li>Ping the host</li>
  <li>Access an SSH server running on the host</li>
</ul>
Now, let's take a look at the procedure and tools we'll employ in this guide.
<h2>2. Procedure and Tools</h2>
In this article,
<strong
  >we'll employ the
  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle VirtualBox</a> virtualization
  software and an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) to access a Microsoft Windows
  host.</strong
>

Generally, the procedure to access the host machine from the guest involves:
<ol>
  <li>Setting up network adapters</li>
  <li>Testing the network to ensure access</li>
</ol>
After this, other tools and software rely on this access to the host machine.
<h2>3. Set Up Network Adapters</h2>
Virtual machines can connect to physical and virtual networks using virtual
network adapters. In VirtualBox, we can set up VMs to connect to different
networks using multiple network modes.

<strong
  >The following network mode configuration gives the VM access to the
  host:</strong
>
<ul>
  <li>Network Access Translation (NAT)</li>
  <li>Host-only Adapter</li>
</ul>
Let's set up the virtual network adapters from the graphical user interface
(GUI).
<h3>3.1. Network Access Translation (NAT)</h3>
In fact, the NAT network mode is the default virtual network adapter in
VirtualBox.
<strong
  >NAT networks allow guest machines to access the host and external networks,
  including the Internet</strong
>. Next, to configure this network mode, we'll click on the guest virtual
machine. Then, we'll go to its settings and select the <em>Network</em> menu:

  alt="Network Menu"
  width="580"
  height="411"
/>

Then, to enable a network adapter, let's check the
<em>Enable Network Adapter</em> checkbox on <em>Adapter 1</em>. Also, we'll
select <em>NAT</em> from the dropdown menu (usually the default setting):
<div>
  <img
    class="aligncenter wp-image-79264 size-large"
    src="https://drafts.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/NAT_SET-UP-1024x743.png"
    alt="Adapter ! network set up"
    width="580"
    height="421"
  />
</div>
Furthermore, we'll ensure the <em>Adapter type</em> is in tandem with the system
hardware specifications. If not, from the dropdown menu, let's select the
matching <em>Adapter Type</em> for our system:

<img
  class="aligncenter wp-image-79263 size-large"
  src="https://drafts.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/NAT_ADVANCED_SET-UP-1024x778.png"
  alt="Advanced Network set up"
  width="580"
  height="441"
/>

Lastly, we'll check the <em>Cable Connected</em> checkbox, enabling the
connection, and click <em>OK</em> to save our settings:
<h3>3.2. <strong>Host-only Adapter</strong></h3>
Additionally,
<strong
  >the Host-only Adapter allows the virtual machine to communicate with the host
  machine.</strong
>
Also, the adapter allows access to other guest machines connected to the
host-only network. To illustrate,
<strong
  >let's set up the second virtual network adapter with Host-only Adapter
  mode.</strong
>
Following our previous procedure for selecting NAT, we'll:
<ol>
  <li>Click on <em>Adapter 2</em></li>
  <li>Check the <em>Enable Network Adapter</em> checkbox</li>
  <li>From the dropdown menu, select <em>Host-only Adapter</em></li>
  <li>Ensure the <em>Adapter Type</em> matches <em>Adapter 1</em></li>
  <li>Set the <em>Promiscuous mode</em> to <em>Allow all</em></li>
  <li>Mark the <em>Cable connected</em> checkbox</li>
</ol>
<img
  class="aligncenter wp-image-79048 size-large"
  src="https://drafts.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/Network_Adapter-2-1024x726.png"
  alt="Network Adapter 2"
  width="580"
  height="411"
/>

Lastly, we'll click <em>OK</em> to save our settings.
<h2>4. Test the Network</h2>
Having set the network adapters correctly,
<strong
  >we can now access the host machine from the guest over the network</strong
>. To illustrate, we'll ping the host from the guest machine using the
<em><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ping-command">ping</a> </em>command.
Also, we'll establish an SSH connection to an SSH server running on the host.
Before the ping, let's check for the host IP address using the command
<em
  ><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/ifconfig-vs-ipconfig"
    >ipconfig</a
  ></em
>:
<pre><code class="language-powershell">PS C:\Users\baeldung&gt; ipconfig

Windows IP Configuration

Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network:

   Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
   Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::f58c:1377:4796:d1cd%16
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.56.1
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
   Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :
...</code></pre>
From the output, the IP address of the host on the
<em>Ethernet adapter VirtualBox Host-Only Network</em> is <em>192.168.56.1</em>.
Now, let's <em>ping</em> the host from the guest using the host's IP address:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ping 192.168.56.1 -c 1
PING 192.168.56.1 (192.168.56.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.56.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=127 time=0.593 ms
--- 192.168.56.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.593/0.593/0.593/0.000 ms</code></pre>
Accordingly, we see that the ping was successful. The <em>-c </em>flag allows us
to specify the count (number of packet requests). Now, we can connect to an SSH
server on the host. To do this, our host needs to have an SSH server running on
the standard <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/cs/ssh-intro">SSH</a> port
<em>22</em>. Also, we have to install an
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/transfer-files-ssh">SSH client</a> on
our guest machine. Using this IP address and the user login, let's connect to
the host:
<pre><code class="language-bash">baeldung@guest $ ssh baeldung@192.168.56.1
The authenticity of host '192.168.56.1 (192.168.56.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:9jqmhko9Yo1EQAS1QeNy9xKceHFG5F8W6kp7EX9U3Rs.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.56.1' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

baeldung@192.168.56.1 $</code></pre>
Now, we have an SSH session with the host. Usually, we need to provide the user
and password or a key to gain access.
<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
In this article, we've seen how to set up a VirtualBox guest machine to access
its host machine over the network. Also, we confirmed the setup by pinging and
accessing the host using the SSH protocol.
