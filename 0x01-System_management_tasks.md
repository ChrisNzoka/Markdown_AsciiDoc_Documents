# System Management Tasks

---

## Estimated Time

01:00

### Overview

This exercise examines various system management tasks that an administrator might perform.
You will configure software repositories, and use some standard Linux tools.

### Objectives

At the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- Verify network configuration
- Create a YUM software repository
- Configure VNC service on a Linux server

### Introduction

When you installed Linux in the previous exercise, you used virtual optical media. This exercise provides you an opportunity to configure additional tools on your operating system. You will also use Linux management tools, from both the CLI as well as GUI.

### Requirements

- This workbook
- A workstation with VNC viewer software connected to a network
- IBM Power server with Linux installed
  - VIOS with configured virtual media resources

## 1. RHEL system management

---

### Preface

> **Note:** Any exercise step that asks for a value from a command output may use an example generated during lab testing. Your results may vary.
> **Important:** You may be sharing the VIOS environment with other learners. Please follow these steps closely so you do not impact other learners.

## Section 1. Network operations

1. Log in to your Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine as you did in the previous exercise.
2. Use the traditional command `ifconfig` to show your current IP address. The command `ifconfig` is part of the **nettools** package, and while deprecated, is still available with RHEL v8.

   ```bash
   # ifconfig -a
   env32: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
   . . .
   ```

3. Use the `ip` command to show the same information. Use the `ip` command as in the following example:

   ```bash
   # ip addr show

   1 1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group
   default qlen 1000
   link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
   inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   inet6 ::1/128 scope host
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   2: env32: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state
   UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
   link/ether fa:56:99:5b:f3:20 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
   inet 10.8.x.xxx/24 brd 10.8.x.255 scope global noprefixroute env32
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   inet6 fe80::f856:99ff:fe5b:f320/64 scope link
   valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
   ```

4. There is a configuration file used at system initialization for network services. Find and view this file.

   - The file is _/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-env32_. Your results will be different from this example:

     ```bash
     # cat ifcfg-env32
     [root@rhel81-ibm-yourname network-scripts]# cat ifcfg-env32

     # Generated by dracut initrd
     NAME="env32"
     HWADDR="fa:56:99:5b:f3:20"
     DEVICE="env32"
     ONBOOT=yes
     NETBOOT=yes
     UUID="630aeeeb-ff12-4224-b57b-4eef4288d874"
     BOOTPROTO=none
     IPADDR="10.8.x.xxx"
     NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
     GATEWAY="10.8.x.254"
     TYPE=Ethernet
     ```

5. Run the commands `arp` and `ip neigh`. Each should show “Neighbor” systems.

   - This is an example of the new `ip` command and the command it is replacing.

   ```bash
   # arp
   Address     HWtype   HWaddress           Flags   Mask
   Iface
   _gateway    ether    00:00:5e:00:01:05   C
   env32
   10.8.6.252  ether    c4:f7:d5:2c:71:27   C
   env32
   ```

   ```bash
   # ip neigh
   10.8.6.254 dev env32 lladdr 00:00:5e:00:01:05 REACHABLE
   10.8.6.252 dev env32 lladdr c4:f7:d5:2c:71:27 STALE
   ```

6. Run the commands `route` and `ip route`. Each should show routing information to other network systems.

   - This is an example of the new ip command and the command it is replacing.

   ```bash
   # route
   Kernel IP routing table
   Destination     Gateway     Genmask        Flags       Metric      Ref     Use     Iface
   default         _gateway    0.0.0.0        UG          100         0       0       env32
   10.8.6.0        0.0.0.0     255.255.255.0  U           100         0       0       env32
   ```

   ```bash
   # ip route
   default via 10.8.6.254 dev env32 proto static metric 100
   10.8.6.0/24 dev env32 proto kernel scope link src 10.8.6.102 metric 100
   ```

## Section 2. Software repository management

    ```

7.  •
    As the root user, issue the command yum repolist. What happens?
    You may see error messages. No software repository is configured by default. As an
    administrator, it’s your job to create one on your system.
    Note: The following steps provide an example of creating a yum repository, and are not intended
    to show the only method you can use.
