<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ffmpeg"><em>ffmpeg</em></a> is a free and
open-source set of multimedia file management tools. Using <em>ffmpeg</em>, we
can convert between different video and audio formats. Also, we can alter sample
rates, record streaming audio and video, resize videos, and concatenate videos.
In this tutorial, we start with the steps to install the program on Ubuntu,
CentOS, and Debian. Importantly, we'll also demonstrate how to concatenate
videos using the command.
<h2>2. Installing <em>ffmpeg</em></h2>
<strong
  >The installation process of <em>ffmpeg</em> requires root or
  <em>sudo</em> privileges.</strong
>
To demonstrate, let's update the <em>apt</em> package list and install
<em>ffmpeg</em>:
<pre
  class="add-horizontal-scrollbar"
><code class="language-bash">$ sudo apt update
...
$ sudo apt install ffmpeg
...</code></pre>
Finally, let's print information about <em>ffmpeg</em> via <em>-version</em> to
check our installation:
<pre
  class="add-horizontal-scrollbar"
><code class="language-bash">$ ffmpeg -version
ffmpeg version 4.4.2-1ubuntu3 Copyright (c) 2000-2022 the FFmpeg developers
...</code></pre>
The output's header shows the version of the program, but we can also see its
configuration and the libraries it uses. Also, we can use
<a href="https://snapcraft.io/">snap</a> to
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/convert-videos-gifs-ffmpeg"
  >install the latest stable version</a
>
of <em>ffmpeg</em> on a Debian/Ubuntu machine. Next, let's move to video
concatenation.
<h2>3. Concatenation Prerequisites</h2>
There are various methods to employ when merging videos using <em>ffmpeg</em>.
Among them are the concat functions:
<ul>
  <li>demuxer</li>
  <li>filter</li>
  <li>protocol</li>
</ul>
Further, each use case depends on the properties of the videos in question.
Importantly, we need to ensure all encoding-related properties align with our
method of choice:
<ul>
  <li>timebase</li>
  <li>height and width</li>
  <li>codecs</li>
  <li>pixel format</li>
</ul>
For some methods, we have to use files with the same encoding, while others
allow different files.
<h2>4. Concat Script Demuxer</h2>
The <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#concat-1">concat</a> script
demuxer is usually the most simple of all methods for merging. It's very fast
and has no quality loss. This is because there is no decoding or re-encoding
required.

<strong>To concatenate videos with the concat demuxer method</strong>, we first
create a text file, listing all video files. Then we run a command, to process
that list. In this case, we'll use the files <em>Kali.mp4</em>,
<em>openLDAP.mp4</em>, and <em>SSH.mp4</em>.
<h3>4.1. Listing Files For Concat Demuxer</h3>
Let's compile a list of videos to concatenate in a text file using the
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/printf-echo"><em>printf</em></a>
command:
<pre
  class="add-horizontal-scrollbar"
><code class="language-bash">$ printf "file '%s'\n" *.mp4 &gt; list.txt</code></pre>
This command writes the name of files ending in <em>.mp4</em> in the current
directory to <em>list.txt</em>. Note, that the
<strong
  >video file paths should be on new lines, within single quotes, prefixed with
  the word <em>file</em></strong
>:
<pre class="add-horizontal-scrollbar"><code class="language-bash">$ cat list.txt
file 'Kali.mp4'
file 'openLDAP.mp4'
file 'SSH.mp4'</code></pre>
<em>ffmpeg </em>reads and concatenates the videos in order, as they appear on
the list. Importantly, the first file begins at timestamp zero (0), while each
ensuing file begins where the previous one ends. Hence,
<strong
  ><i>ffmpeg</i> uses the duration of each file to adjust the timestamps of the
  next file</strong
>.
<h3>4.2. Concatenating Using Concat Demuxer</h3>
Now, let's use the <em>-f concat</em> flag to merge the videos from our
<em>list.txt</em> file:
<pre
  class="highlight shell"
><code>$ ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy outfile.mp4</code></pre>
Here, the value of the <em>-i</em> flag indicates the path to the input file.
Also, <em>-c copy</em> ensures there is no re-encoding. Next, we add
<strong
  ><em>-safe</em> as an important option, the value of which decides whether to
  reject (<em>1</em>) or accept (<em>0</em>) unsafe paths</strong
>:

<code>$ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i list.txt -c copy outfile.mp4</code>

Mostly, a file path is safe if it:
<ul>
  <li>does not specify a protocol</li>
  <li>
    contains only characters from the portable character set (letters, numerals,
    period, underscore, and hyphen)
  </li>
  <li>has no period at the beginning of its name</li>
</ul>
Lastly, the transcoding process of <em>ff</em><em>mpeg</em> includes demuxing,
decoding, encoding, and muxing. Since we're using <em>-c copy</em>, this leaves
only demuxing and muxing.
<h2>5. Concat Multimedia Filter</h2>
Of course, we often have videos with different encodings. We can merge those
with the concat filter since it re-encodes as part of its process. Also, it
enables filtering the input files before merging. Since it goes through the
whole transcoding chain, this method is generally slower. Critically,
<strong
  >for the concat filter to work correctly, all video files must start at
  timestamp zero (0.00).</strong
>
<h3>5.1. Concatenating Videos With a Single Audio Stream</h3>
To explain the contact filter, we'll use <em>start.mkv</em>, <em>body.mkv</em>,
and <em>rear.mkv</em> with a single audio stream:
<pre
  class="example"
><code>$ ffmpeg -i start.mkv -i body.mkv -i rear.mkv -filter_complex \
  "[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a]
  concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]" \
  -map "[v]" -map "[a]" output.mkv</code></pre>
Here's a quick rundown of what's going on in the command:
<ol>
  <li>Supply input files with the <em>-i </em>flags</li>
  <li>Use <em>-filter_complex</em> to select streams from the input files</li>
  <li>
    Select the actual streams in a specific order: video and audio from the
    first, second, and third file
  </li>
  <li>Use the filter <em>concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]</em></li>
  <li>Map the resulting audio and video streams to the output</li>
</ol>
In step 4, the number of files we want to join is in the value of
<em>n</em> (default is 2). Next, we follow with <em>v</em> (default is 1), which
sets the number of output video streams. Similarly, <em>a</em> (default is 0)
sets the number of audio streams in each section. It also sets the number of
output audio streams. Finally, the <em>-map</em> flag in step 5 allows for a
custom stream selection in each output file if there are multiple. Users can
skip -<em>map</em> and let <em>ffmpeg</em> handle stream selection.
<h3>5.2. Concatenating Videos With Multiple Audio Streams</h3>
Likewise, let's concatenate an opening, an episode, and an ending, with two
audio streams. That is, video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2:
<pre
  class="example"
><code>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
 '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
  concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
 -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv</code></pre>
Notice that the second line in this example is like
<em>[0:v] [0:a] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a] [2:a]</em> in the notation
of our previous examples. In fact, this shows that we have a single video stream
(<em>[0:v]</em>, <em>[1:v]</em>, <em>[2:v]</em>) and dual audio streams
(<em>[0:a][0:a]</em>, <em>[1:a][1:a]</em>, <em>[2:a][2:a]</em>).
<h2>6. Physical Concatenation Protocol</h2>
The concat protocol is another way of concatenating videos with <em>ffmpeg</em>.
It reads and seeks from a large pool of resources, treating each one as unique.
However,
<strong
  >this approach doesn't work with several formats, including
  <em>MP4</em></strong
>. It's the nature of these formats as well as the method's basic concatenation
that prevents its general application.
<strong
  >We can use the concat protocol with formats like MPEG, which allows
  file-level concatenation</strong
>. For example, let's concatenate the files <em>clay.mpeg</em>,
<em>sculpt.mpeg</em>, and <em>mold.mpeg</em>:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ffmpeg -i "concat:clay.mpeg\|sculpt.mpeg\|mold.mpeg" -c copy output.mkv</code></pre>
Notice that we use <em>\</em> (backslash) to escape the pipe symbol.
<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>

<em>ffmpeg</em>. We also saw how to install <em>ffmpeg</em> on various Linux
distributions.
