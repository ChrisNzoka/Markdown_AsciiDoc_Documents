<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<strong
  >Package files are the base units of software in the Linux packaging
  system</strong
>. Basically, it's a compressed group of files that may comprise:
<ul>
  <li>a number of programs</li>
  <li>data files that support the programs</li>
  <li>package metadata</li>
  <li>package pre-installation and post-installation scripts</li>
</ul>
In this tutorial, we'll see how to remove a specific type of package from a
Linux system.
<h2>2. RPM Package Manager</h2>
<strong

    >RPM</a
  >
  stands for Red Hat Package Manager</strong
>. It provides the standard way to package software for the
<a
  href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux"
  >Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a
>
(RHEL) distribution and its close relatives
<a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a>,
<a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a>, and
<a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE</a>. Also, Linux package management
systems usually consist of two types of tools:
<ul>
  <li>
    low-level tools to perform tasks such as installing and erasing package
    files
  </li>
  <li>
    high-level tools that carry out dependency resolution and metadata searching
  </li>
</ul>
<strong
  >While all Red Hat-style Linux distributions use the same low-level program
  <em
    ><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/install-rpm-arch-based-distros"
      >rpm</a
    >,</em
  >
  the high-level tools are not the same</strong
>. Next, we'll talk about the high-level program
<em
  ><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/list-installed-packages">dnf</a>,</em

which the Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS use.
<h2>3. Removing RPM Packages With <em>dnf</em></h2>
Notably, we can uninstall or remove software using high-level or low-level
tools.
<strong
  >Dandified Yum (DNF) is a high-level software package tool for RPM-based Linux
  distributions</strong
>. It's the new-age version of the popular
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/yum-and-apt">Yum</a> package manager. We
can use the <em>dnf </em>program to remove a single package or a list of
packages. To uninstall a particular software package, let's run the following
command as a superuser:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo dnf remove package_name</code></pre>
Critically,
<strong>the RPM package name differs from the RPM package file name</strong>. In
fact, the package file names consist of five elements:
<ul>
  <li>package name</li>
  <li>version</li>
  <li>release</li>
  <li>architecture</li>
  <li><em>.rpm</em> suffix</li>
</ul>

  alt="RPM package file name"
  width="996"
  height="427"
/>

Further, we can remove multiple packages at once by adding more package names to
the command. For instance, the following command removes the packages listed
after the <em>remove</em> keyword:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo dnf remove vidutils rhyme zipper</code></pre>
Here, we only need the package name to remove a package from our system.
However, erasing a package using <em>dnf </em>may also remove other packages
that depend on it. We'll employ the low-level tool <em>rpm </em>in a later
section to remove a package without touching its dependencies.
<h2>4. Removing RPM Packages With <em>rpm</em></h2>
Unlike <em>dnf</em>, <strong
  ><em>rpm</em> can remove a package without removing packages that depend on
  it</strong
>. In other words, the <em>rpm </em>program doesn't handle dependency
resolution. To erase a program with <em>rpm,</em> we run the
<em>rpm </em>command with the <em>-e</em> flag:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo rpm -e util-linux</code></pre>
Usually, if other packages need the one we're uninstalling, <em>rpm -e</em> will
fail. Consequently, it produces an error message. A successful uninstall
produces no output. Still, programs in Linux are hardly stand-alone. Instead,
they often rely on the presence of other software units. Hence, the system
blocks operations that would cause problems from completion like:
<ul>
  <li>removing a package that another package depends on</li>
  <li>
    installing a package when the system needs initial software to run the
    package
  </li>
</ul>
For example, we can see the <em>Failed dependencies</em> error in the following
command output:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ sudo rpm --test -e xz

error: Failed dependencies:
xz is needed by (installed) pcp-5.1.1-4.el8_3.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) sos-3.9.1-6.el8.noarch
xz is needed by (installed) gettext-devel-0.19.8.1-17.el8.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) libreport-2.9.5-15.el8.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) dracut-049-95.git20200804.el8_3.4.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu-6.0.0-28.module+el8.3.0+7827+5e65edd7.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) rpm-build-4.14.3-4.el8.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) libguestfs-1:1.40.2-25.module+el8.3.0+7421+642fe24f.x86_64
xz is needed by (installed) sysstat-11.7.3-5.el8.x86_64
/usr/bin/xz is needed by (installed) file-roller-3.28.1-3.el8.x86_64</code></pre>
The <em>--test</em> flag with <em>-e</em> checks if the erase command would
succeed or fail without actually doing the uninstall. If the process is
successful, <em>rpm</em> prints no output.
<h2>5. Removing RPM Packages Forcefully</h2>
Indeed, we can force <em>rpm</em> to remove a package that gives us a
<em>Failed dependencies</em> error. To do so, we include some options in the
<em>rpm </em>command:
<pre><code>$ sudo rpm -e --allmatches --nodeps --noscripts --notriggers --test PACKAGE_NAME
</code></pre>
Here are the roles of the flags in the command:
<ul>
  <li><em>PACKAGE_NAME</em> - the name of the package to work with</li>
  <li><em>-e</em> or <em>--erase</em> - removes the package</li>
  <li>
    <em>--allmatches </em>- removes all versions of packages that match the <em
      >PACKAGE_NAME</em
    >
  </li>
  <li><em>--nodeps </em>- prevents dependency checks</li>
  <li>
    <em>--noscripts </em>- blocks the command from executing scriptlets around
    the package processing
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>--notriggers </em>- similar to <em>--noscripts, </em> stops the command
    from triggering scripts
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>--test</em> - checks if the uninstall would succeed or fail without
    actually performing actions
  </li>
</ul>
In addition,
<strong
  >using the <em>--nodeps</em> flag may cause other programs on the system to
  stop working.</strong
>
Essentially, installing or removing packages with <em>rpm --nodeps</em> can
cause applications or the system to malfunction or crash. Further, in critical
cases,
<strong
  >fixing such problems may require us to reinstall the operating system or boot
  into a rescue environment.</strong
>

Because of this, it's usually better to use package management with dependency
resolution, regardless of the difficulties it may pose.
<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
In this article, we saw the ways to remove an RPM package from the Linux system.
Also, we learned how to remove an RPM package with dependencies forcefully. We
understood that the Dandified Yum package manager can carry out dependency
resolution by fetching packages from online repositories, making it safer than
using the low-level <em>rpm</em> directly.
