<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vi-vim-editors">Vim</a> text editor
supports autocompletion for the standard text files by default. Also, when
configured properly, Vim enables an autocomplete feature for files with code in
the languages it recognizes. In this tutorial, we'll see
<strong>how the autocompletion support in Vim works.</strong>
<h2>2. Built-in Support</h2>
Of course, recent versions of the Vim editor come with a built-in autocomplete
feature.
<strong
  >Vim completes words by checking the available terms currently in the
  buffer</strong
>. Importantly, this functionality is case-sensitive.
<h3>2.1. <em>Ctrl-N</em></h3>
First, we'll see how to use the autocomplete feature in a standard text file.
For this purpose, let's open an example .<em>vimrc</em> configuration file.
Next, we'll enter a few characters of a word we need to write and
<strong>press <em>Ctrl-N </em>to trigger autocompletion</strong>. If Vim finds
only one match, it will automatically complete the term. However,
<strong
  >if Vim finds more than one match for the text, a list of words will
  appear</strong
>:

  alt="ctrl-n"
  width="793"
  height="597"
/>

We can select the preferable term from the list. Also,
<strong>we can use <em>Ctrl</em>-P to make the list cycle backward</strong>.
Alternatively, we can use the arrow keys to move up and down the list.
<strong
  >If the program finds no match to complete a word, we'll see an error stating </strong
><em><strong>Pattern not Found</strong>:</em>

<img
  class="aligncenter wp-image-80757 size-full"
  src="https://drafts.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Screenshot-25-1.png"
  alt="ctrl-n_autocompletion"
  width="797"
  height="596"
/>

Also, to see Vim's documentation on the autocomplete functionality, we can
use <em>:help i_CTRL-N</em>.
<h3>2.2. Omnicompletion</h3>
<a href="https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3172"
  >Omnicompletion</a
>
provides an intelligent autocompletion feature for programs in Vim. When called,
<strong
  >Omnicompletion examines the text before the cursor to predict the intended
  word</strong
>. Ordinarily, Omnicompletion is not available by default. Now, to enable
Omnicompletion features on Vim, let's add the following to our
<em>~/.vimrc:</em>
<pre><code class="language-bash">" Enable plugins and load plugin for the detected file type.
filetype plugin on
" Enable Omnicomplete features
set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete</code></pre>
Here, the double quotation marks begin comment lines. Below each comment is the
line with the described function. Finally,
<strong>we can press <em>Ctrl-X</em> and <em>Ctrl-O</em> to start </strong
><strong>Omnicompletion</strong>. To check whether Omnicompletion is working,
<strong>we can use the command <em>:echo &amp;omnifunc</em> in a file</strong>.
In addition,
<strong>we can set up Omnicompletion for specific language syntax in Vim</strong
>. For example, to set up autocompletion for JavaScript syntax, we'll enter the
following command in the Vim command mode and press <em>Enter</em>:
<pre><code class="language-bash">:set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS
</code></pre>
Similarly, the following commands work for HTML, CSS, and PHP, respectively:
<ul>
  <li><em>:set omnifunc=htmlcomplete#CompleteTags</em></li>
  <li><em>:set omnifunc=csscomplete#CompleteCSS</em></li>
  <li><em>:set omnifunc=phpcomplete#CompletePHP</em></li>
</ul>
Furthermore, Vim autocompletion has some excellent substitutes. The command
<em>:h ins-completion</em> shows the variety of built-in completion options on
our system.
<h2>3. Plugins</h2>
Generally, plugins add extra functionality to any program. Thus,
<strong>we can add plugins to Vim to extend its auto-completion features</strong
>. Notably, we can employ
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/vim-install-neovim-plugins"
  >plugin managers</a
> like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim">vundle</a> to ease the plugin
installation process. Following, let's look at some autocompletion plugins for
vim and their unique features.
<h3>3.1. SuperTab</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab">SuperTab</a> is a Vim
autocompletion plugin that allows the use of Tab for all insert completions.
<strong
  >The plugin enables us to hit Tab after a partial entry to get an
  autocompletion functionality</strong
>. For instance, we might want to type "editors". So, we enter "e" and press
Tab. The plugin shows a keyword completion list. Then we can select the desired
word from the list. The SuperTab plugin is similar to the built-in
Omnicompletion alternative. However, there are a few differences, as we can:
<ul>
  <li dir="auto">configure it to suit our needs</li>
  <li dir="auto">configure different keys to trigger the completion</li>
  <li dir="auto">get a completion result when Omnicompletion returns none</li>
</ul>
To install and set up SuperTab, let's create a directory for the installation:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
</code></pre>
Next, let's clone the SuperTab repository via
<a href="https://www.baeldung.com/git-guide"><em>git</em></a
>:
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ervandew/supertab.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/supertab
</code></pre>
Further, we'll add <em>packloadall</em> to our <em>~/.vimrc</em> file:
<pre><code class="language-bash">" Enable packloadall for pack plugins.
packloadall</code></pre>
Finally, we can get to the
<a href="https://github.com/ervandew/supertab/blob/master/doc/supertab.txt"
  >SuperTab documentation</a
>
from within Vim using the <em>:help supertab</em> command.
<h3>3.2. Jedi-Vim</h3>
Next, <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim">Jedi-Vim</a> is a Python
autocompletion plugin within Vim. Basically, it's a
<strong
  >Vim binding to the autocompletion library
  <a href="http://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a></strong
>. Uniquely, Jedi-Vim stands out with its broad support for most of Python's
core features. We can use
<a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a> to install Jedi-Vim.
To illustrate, let's add the plugin to our configuration file:
<pre><code class="language-bash">Plugin 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'</code></pre>
Next, we'll save and source the file. After that, we run the
<em>:PluginInstall </em>command in Vim. Importantly,
<strong>to use Jedi-Vim while coding, we press </strong
><em><strong>Ctrl-Space</strong></em
>. As with other plugins, we can access the
<a href="http://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/blob/master/doc/jedi-vim.txt"
  >Jedi-Vim documentation</a
>
in <em>vim</em> with the <em>:help jedi-vim</em> command.
<h3>3.3. YouCompleteMe</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> is a fast
and intelligent suggest-as-you-type code-completion and refactoring engine for
Vim. It has several completion engines built in. Hence,<strong>
  YouCompleteMe can work with almost any language</strong
>. Indeed, the YouCompleteMe plugin is unique and has several advantages over
other autocompletion plugins:
<ul>
  <li>works with any programing language</li>
  <li>
    we don't have to press any keyboard combination to trigger the
    autocompletion
  </li>
  <li>
    the filtering is not based on the input being a string prefix of the
    completion (but that works too)
  </li>
</ul>
Similar to other plugins, we use Tab to go through any valid suggestions. The
<a href="https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe#installation"
  >YouCompleteMe installation</a
>
is outside the scope of this article. However, an important step is to install
<a
  href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/compile-32-bit-binary-on-64-bit-os#using-cmake"
  >CMake</a
>
and Python. In Debian-based systems, we can do that via <a
  href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/yum-and-apt#apt-advanced-packaging-tool"
  ><em>apt</em></a
>:
<div
  class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto"
>
  <pre
    class="notranslate"
  ><code>$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake python3-dev</code></pre>
  <div class="open_grepper_editor" title="Edit &amp; Save To Grepper">
    Further, we'll install mono-complete, go, node, java, and npm
  </div>
</div>
<div
  class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto"
>
  <pre
    class="notranslate"
  ><code>$ sudo apt install mono-complete golang nodejs default-jdk npm
</code></pre>
</div>
After having the necessary packages, we follow the installation guide to set up
and compile YouCompleteMe.
<h2>4. Summary</h2>
In conclusion, autocompletion is a great feature in the Vim editor. We have seen
how to use the built-in autocompletion features in Vim but also learned about
plugins with the same function.
